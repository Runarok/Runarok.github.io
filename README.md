Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a coder based in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, with a passion for manga, anime, music, and movies. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, including games and various web experiments.

## About Me

I enjoy coding and have experience in languages such as C, C++, and Python. Currently, I primarily work with HTML, CSS, and Java. Most of my projects are built with basic HTML coding that I've learned along the way, often utilizing online resources and tools like ChatGPT. I want to be clear: I don’t intend to present myself as a great coder; my work is mainly basic, and anyone interested is welcome to use and improve upon it. Coding has been a passion of mine, and I've invested a lot of time into these projects.

## Meaning Behind My Name

**"Runarok"** is a combination of two Norse elements:

- **Runar**: Derived from the word "rún" (meaning "rune" or "mystery" in Old Norse), often associated with ancient symbols used for divination, magic, and wisdom.
- **Rok**: A variation of the word "rök," meaning "fate" or "doom" in Old Norse, often referring to a significant, transformative event, like the end of the world (Ragnarök).

**"Runarok"** can be interpreted as:

- The **fate of runes** or the **mystery of fate**, combining ancient wisdom and the inevitability of destiny.
- A powerful, mystical force that brings about change or destruction, evoking images of an inevitable and profound event, like the cataclysmic events in Norse mythology (**Ragnarök**).
